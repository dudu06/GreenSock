GreenSock
=========

GreenSock is a great tool for animations. In comparison to jQuery animations, its deemed to be faster. 
From what I've read JS animations offer more flexibility compared to CSS animations. The newer CSS animations are not compatible 
across IE browsers and the GS syntax is simple enough for anyone to learn. 

I created this to play around with the different things GS can do. 

If you download as a zip file and open in your browser window, you'll see that there is an image of a car! 

Uncomment different sections in the script tags of the index.html file and be amazed.
